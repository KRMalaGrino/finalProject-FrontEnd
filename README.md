# Final Project - News Explorer - Frontend

Developed a responsive web application that allows users to search news articles from across the web and curate a personalized collection of saved articles. Implemented a dedicated "Saved Articles" dashboard, and an informative "About the Author" section. The application is responsive and also includes a footer with social media links. This was my final project as a student at TripleTen Coding Academy .
